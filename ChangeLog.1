This is ChangeLog.1 for pgtclng: the PostgreSQL Tcl Interface Library.
This is the ChangeLog from the Gborg 'pgtcl' project. This does not
record all the changes made by that project; notably the addition of
asynchronous commands, pg_escape_string, and new TEA build.

2002-11-19  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>

    * Improved the performance of -list a little bit

2002-11-15  Karl Lehenbauer <karl@procplace.com>

    * Tagged for 1.4b3

    * Fix pg_listen.  (callback string wasn't properly terminated)
      Also made slight performance improvements in pg_listen.

    * Cleanup memory leaks in pg_result.

    * Fixed bug in pg_result -assignbyidx

    * Convert all the "#ifdef TCL_ARRAYS" where tcl_value was called if 
      defined and not called if not defined to always "call" tcl_value.  
      In the case where TCL_ARRAYS isn't defined, tcl_value is now defined 
      as a macro that returns whatever was given to it, making it a no-op.

      This change allows the code to be compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG enabled
      to look for memory leaks.

2002-11-06  Karl Lehenbauer <karl@procplace.com>

    * Tagged for 1.4b2

    * Create the libpgtcl shared library in a way where it can find both 
      the Postgres shared library it needs (libpq) and the Tcl shared
      library it needs (libtcl).

2002-11-05  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>

    * added -list and -llist options to pg_result to return the
      results as a list and list of lists
