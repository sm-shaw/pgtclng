Change file for PostgreSQL-8.1.4 build of libpq with Borland BCC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


1)
In the source directory src\include
edit the file pg_config.h.win32 (which will be copied to pg_config.h,
or edit pg_config.h itself after copying).

In the block that is conditional on the Borland compiler, add an empty
definition of inline so the file looks like this:

      #ifdef __BORLANDC__
      #define inline
      ...


2)

In the source directory interfaces\libpq, edit the file bcc32.mak to change
the creation of the pg_config_paths.h file so the line looks like this:

      pg_config_paths.h: bcc32.mak
          echo \#define SYSCONFDIR "" > pg_config_paths.h


Notes:
  Change #2 is known to have been fixed in PostgreSQL-8.1.5
