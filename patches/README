This directory contains source patches or source change notes files for
for PostgreSQL releases. These patches or changes must be applied to
PostgreSQL in order to build the PostgreSQL library libpq on Windows
using the Borland BCC compiler.

  Important: These are only used when building PostgreSQL libpq
  on Windows, using Borland BCC, for use with pgtcl-ng. They are
  not used on any Linux or Unix-like platform (although they will
  not do any harm if applied).

Before PostgreSQL-8.2.0, changes were included in the Pgtcl-Ng Reference
Manual. Starting with the 2007-01-15 release of the manual, the necessary
changes are documented in this directory instead.

Why are changes to some PostgreSQL releases needed in order to build libpq
with BCC? Since BCC is not a compiler supported for use by the PostgreSQL
Group, they do not test BCC builds before releasing.  As a result,
PostgreSQL releases sometimes contain changes to the source code which
breaks the BCC build. When this occurs, patches and changes are developed
for use with pgtcl-ng, and are submitted to the PostgreSQL group for
inclusion in the next release.
